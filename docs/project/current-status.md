# LanternLeaf Current Status

Updated: 2026-09-09 after real-desktop Goal 0008 A7 pretty highlight/scroll diagnosis

This file contains verified or explicitly bounded evidence only. Historical roadmap checkboxes are not accepted as current proof.

## Workspace / architecture

**VERIFIED PRESENT**

- Native Rust + `eframe`/`egui` is the authoritative desktop architecture.
- Workspace contains the root package plus `lanternleaf-core`, `lanternleaf-app`, and `lanternleaf-egui`.
- Tauri/React/WebView remains historical reference only.

## Gate 0 — Windows baseline

**COMPLETE**

Required hosted Windows CI proves:

- MSVC/Pandoc prerequisite setup;
- `cargo check --workspace`;
- `cargo build --workspace`;
- normal-parallel `cargo test --workspace`.

Hosted renderer capability remains a separate truthful probe and does not block required build/test evidence.

## Gate 1 — TTS backend boundary + Windows TTS

**COMPLETE AT ARCHITECTURE / SYNTHESIS LAYER**

Active flow:

`canonical sentence -> selected synthesis backend -> cached WAV -> shared Rodio/Sonic playback -> canonical session progression`

Verified:

- Piper remains the default backend;
- WinRT Windows TTS uses installed stable voice IDs;
- implicit Windows default resolves to the actual effective voice before cache identity;
- backend/voice changes during active speech resynchronize without losing canonical cursor ownership;
- Piper/eSpeak setup is Piper-only;
- Windows WAV output decodes through shared Rodio;
- missing configured Windows voices fail explicitly.

Real speaker playback and egui interaction remain real-desktop verification items.

## Goal-completion notifications

**IMPLEMENTED / MULTI-ATTEMPT PROTOCOL DEFINED**

Repository macro-goals and Codex Goal UI sessions are now explicitly separate lifecycles.

A director rejection may reopen the same repository goal under a fresh Codex Goal session. The watcher is re-armed per execution attempt, terminal state is signaled only after push, and checkout restoration cannot erase the checkout-safe `.git/lanternleaf-goal-state/<id>.terminal` signal.

The human does not manually start/reset the watcher.

## Gate 2 — Non-PDF reader/TTS parity

**AUTOMATED PARITY COMPLETE; REAL-DESKTOP SIGNOFF PENDING**

Goal 0006 established restart-era evidence for:

- TXT;
- Markdown;
- HTML;
- EPUB.

Representative project-owned fixtures now exercise the real source -> session path.

Verified automated behavior includes:

- source ingestion and canonical `tts_text`;
- source-family syntax cleanliness;
- canonical sentence/page accounting;
- sentence anchors;
- text-only/pretty ownership invariants;
- real-session search set/next/previous selection;
- sentence click/highlight ownership;
- persistence/reopen;
- idempotent source/cache cleanup;
- Rust-native Markdown/HTML/EPUB pretty structures;
- exact/nearest anchor fallback behavior;
- auto-scroll duplicate/fallback decision semantics;
- simulated TTS runtime behavior across all four source families on the Pandoc-capable Windows runner;
- backend-neutral reader cursor semantics;
- source -> real TXT session -> canonical sentence -> Windows synthesis -> Rodio decode.

Authoritative correction run `34159728934` passed both Windows jobs.

Observed final test evidence includes:

- core unit tests: 171 passed / 0 failed;
- non-PDF source/session parity: green;
- non-PDF simulated runtime parity: green;
- native pretty parity: 3 passed / 0 failed;
- Windows TTS integration: 2 passed / 0 failed.

Goal 0006 also fixed bounded Markdown canonicalization so raw representative Markdown syntax is not spoken as canonical text.

### Real-desktop evidence now observed

A repo-native Windows run using `git pull -> .\qa.ps1` successfully completed dependency bootstrap, built LanternLeaf, and entered the native egui shell on the human Windows machine. The run used isolated `.qa/windows` state, so an initially empty library is expected until files or an external library source are opened.

This closes the basic real-desktop build/launch uncertainty. It does **not** yet prove speaker playback, voice selection, visible render quality, or end-user reader ergonomics.

### Remaining Gate 2 evidence

Hosted CI cannot honestly prove:

- visible pretty/text rendering quality;
- actual window scrolling/jump comfort;
- physical speaker playback;
- interactive Windows voice selection;
- end-user play/pause/seek ergonomics;
- reopen behavior as experienced through the GUI.

A concise Windows checklist exists at `docs/qa/non-pdf-reader-windows-checklist.md`.

Goal 0007 proved that a prebuilt QA bundle could be produced, but the human rejected artifact download/extraction as unnecessary workflow friction.

The accepted human workflow is now repo-native:

- `deps.ps1` owns Windows dependency/bootstrap state;
- `qa.ps1` owns isolated real-desktop QA preparation/build/launch;
- generated QA state/fixtures/logs live under ignored `.qa/`;
- GitHub Actions artifacts are not part of ordinary manual testing.

## PDF

**CORE CONTRACT SET REPAIRED; INTERACTIVE VISUAL/TTS WORK PENDING**

Goal 0003 repaired the bounded classifier/OCR/reading-order/cache contract set.

Gate 3 native PDF visual stability begins only after Gate 2 real-desktop signoff.

## Caliberate / Calibre library integration

**GOAL 0008 A8.1 — AUDIO BOUNDARY/REPAINT GOOD; TRUE SOURCE-BORN PROVENANCE STILL REQUIRED**

Accepted integration:

- Caliberate is the preferred/default local provider at `http://127.0.0.1:8181`;
- paged `/api/v1/books` catalog retrieval maps into the existing library browser;
- supported formats materialize from `/api/v1/books/{id}/content/{format}`;
- materialized sources enter the existing LanternLeaf source/session/TTS path;
- provider-aware caches prevent Caliberate/legacy Calibre cross-contamination;
- Caliberate API-key auth and legacy Basic auth remain isolated;
- Caliberate does not probe legacy Calibre cover endpoints;
- legacy Calibre catalog/download behavior remains covered by deterministic HTTP regression tests.

Authoritative Windows run `34185172624` passed both jobs and the core suite reached **180 passed / 0 failed**.

A3 remains accepted for Caliberate materialization/native EPUB ingestion/cache recovery, and A4 successfully reduced real EPUB open time to an acceptable ~1–2 seconds. Real-desktop A4 signoff nevertheless failed immediately afterward: a 1.34 MB / 10,488-sentence EPUB produced 1,644 native pretty blocks and the egui reader became catastrophically unresponsive, with roughly 2–3 second pointer-hover latency. Pressing TTS Play then terminated the process with a main-thread stack overflow before the playback-worker-start diagnostic. Director inspection localizes deterministic causes: full `AppState` deep cloning per frame includes the 104,732-book catalog; heavyweight `ReaderSnapshot` content is copied through high-frequency state/events; the pretty renderer submits all 1,644 blocks to egui each frame without virtualization; and TTS planning is synchronously entered from the egui main-thread command handler against a second session copy. Goal 0008 is reopened as A5 to repair native frame ownership/virtualization, lightweight snapshot/event boundaries, off-main TTS control, and the QA performance profile. No further human QA until A5 is implemented, validated, reviewed, and integrated.

## Historical Tauri / React / WebView implementation

**HISTORICAL / OBSOLETE AS PRODUCTION TARGET**

It may be consulted for behavioral evidence only.


### A5 director review update

The first A5 implementation at `ca91d6ce...` is **not integrated**. Arc-backed frame state, bounded pretty rendering, off-main command submission, and the optimized QA profile are good and must be preserved. Director inspection found that persistence and TTS worker hot paths still construct full `ReaderSnapshot` values, and the app still owns separate effect/TTS `ReaderSession` values synchronized only by source-path changes. A5.1 must collapse to one canonical session handle and use lightweight TTS/persistence projections before another real-desktop run.


### A5.1 accepted correction

A5.1 is now integrated. Production normal reader effects, TTS runtime, and persistence share one canonical `Arc<Mutex<Option<ReaderSession>>>`. TTS hot paths use lightweight playback/session projections rather than full document snapshots, and persistence derives bookmark/config/playback data directly. Deterministic 10k+ sentence regressions prove zero full `ReaderSnapshot` construction during TTS worker Play/100 seeks and persistence flush. Windows CI run `34280238462` passed. The remaining evidence is one real-desktop large-EPUB responsiveness and Windows TTS run using the optimized default `qa.ps1` profile.


### A6 real-desktop diagnosis

A5/A5.1 native performance corrections are now positively observed on the human machine: the previously unusable large EPUB is described as substantially less laggy and “pretty snappy.” TTS Play no longer stack-overflows, but signoff still fails because the repo-native Windows QA configuration resolves an omitted backend to Piper. The runtime attempted the repository's Linux Piper model path and failed before producing audio. A6 corrects the platform default/QA staging contract so normal Windows QA actually exercises Windows TTS without manual backend selection.

### A6 accepted correction

A6 is integrated. Omitted TTS backend is platform-aware, normal Windows `qa.ps1` deterministically overrides staged QA state to Windows TTS on every run, portable defaults no longer contain developer/Linux Piper paths, TTS startup failures become visible actionable native notifications, and focused QA handoff diagnostics include TTS/audio terms. Windows CI run `34304570627` passed staged QA config -> Windows backend -> installed voice -> WAV synthesis -> Rodio decode plus normal workspace validation. The large native EPUB responsiveness portion already passed on the human machine; only actual speaker playback and interactive TTS controls remain.


### A7 real-desktop diagnosis

A6's actual Windows-audio objective is now positively verified: repo-native QA selects Windows, physical speech is audible, and installed Windows voices can be changed successfully. Large-EPUB open/UI performance also remains fast/snappy.

Goal 0008 is still blocked by presentation synchronization. Canonical TTS cursor progression is coherent, but the HTML pretty renderer maps canonical sentences through a text-keyed block index and falls back to proportional HTML anchors when that lookup misses; auto-scroll is also a one-shot request consumed before successful target rendering. This allows duplicate/mismatched sentences to jump to unrelated blocks and allows off-screen follow requests to disappear. A7 replaces this with ordered canonical-sentence -> pretty-target alignment, durable follow state, canonical-cursor-driven scrolling, and stable variable-height bounded virtualization.


### A7.1 director review

The first A7 implementation is not integrated. It correctly replaces text-keyed/proportional native-pretty targeting with ordered canonical sentence targets and adds bounded variable-height virtualization, but explicit Jump-to-highlight is currently inert because it clears bookkeeping without creating a pending target. The contract's required 100+ transition/Next/Prev/Pause/Resume/Repeat/unchanged-settings regression coverage is also absent, and committed duplicate suppression is not source-aware. A7.1 is a bounded correction preserving the first A7 architecture. No human QA yet.


### A7/A7.1 accepted correction

A7/A7.1 is integrated. Native pretty TTS synchronization now uses ordered canonical display-sentence targets, refuses proportional/distant HTML fallback for unmapped spoken sentences, carries durable source-aware follow targets, derives automatic follow only from canonical cursor transitions, supports explicit Jump-to-highlight re-arming, and retains bounded variable-height virtualization. Windows CI run `34403241270` is green. The remaining Gate 2.5 evidence is one sustained real-desktop highlight/viewport-follow run on the same large EPUB.


### A8 real-desktop diagnosis

A7/A7.1 did not solve real spoken-sentence synchronization. Windows audio remains correct and native performance remains good, but pretty highlight/follow is effectively absent; text-only only partially follows and lags. Director inspection finds no egui repaint scheduling for background TTS progress, duration-timer-based cursor advancement instead of real audio sentence boundaries, and native EPUB identity still reconstructed after ingestion by matching independently transformed `html2text` and pretty-block streams. A8 moves canonical sentence identity into source ingestion and carries it through audio and rendering, with semantic audio-boundary events and active-TTS repaint scheduling.


### A8.1 director review

The first A8 branch is not integrated. Rodio first-sample markers, semantic SentenceStarted events, removal of duration-timer cursor advancement, and active egui repaint scheduling are good. The central source-identity requirement was not met: EPUB provenance is still assigned by re-extracting block text and post-hoc matching it against a separately generated canonical sentence stream, with no neutral structured provenance model. The real EPUB and simulated-boundary tests also do not satisfy the required end-to-end/window/control coverage. A8.1 preserves the good A8 runtime work and replaces the fake provenance layer with one-pass structured extraction plus explicit canonical IDs on audio boundaries.
